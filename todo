- nd build might not know flake authentication as in the flake alias we have?
- we start zsh, so bash functions are gone
- but there are still a great many vars, some, like SHELL, is now wrong (not zsh)
- it doesnt point to symlinked and atomically switchable envs, its all directly into nix
- how to make a reusable tmux config for this?
